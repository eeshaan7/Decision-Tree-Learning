Compiling and running code
----------------------------
1. Go to the code folder. Open terminal there.
$ g++ main.cpp

$ ./a.out label.feat 2
$ ./a.out label.feat 3
$ ./a.out label.feat 4
$ ./a.out label.feat 5

Where 2, 3, 4, 5 is Expt Number. 

Make sure that label.feat is available, and selected-feature-indices.txt is available within the code folder.
If the data file and feature file is present somewhere else, the code can be run by:
./a.out data_file_location exptno feature_file_location


For generating data and selected features, make sure ../aclImdb is available.
$ g++ exp1.cpp
$ ./a.out
../data.feat and ../selected-feature-indices.txt would be generated
